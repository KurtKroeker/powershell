# Notes from PowerShell Lunch & Learn

## Presentation Notes

* There is more than 1 hour of material as presented; I ran out of time before even getting to the "Gotchas" slide
* "commandlets", not "cmdlets"
* Make sure I comment on working with strings
* if possible, change string highlighting from green to something else (maybe change PS console background to black); hard to see from a distance
* Keep the active command prompt up high on the projector
* Make sure I keep text size large for the ISE
* Stick to the PowerPoint more
* Handheld notes don't work so well...move my presenter's notes into a laptop or the PPT itself (probably laptop is better w/PPT or something for me only)
* Reorganize the PS L&L repository

# Content Notes

* Note that you can select blocks of code in ISE and just run those lines
* Comment on -WhatIf parameter (run but don't run)
* Investigate PS and local directory paths
* Add section for including external PS1 files as dependencies using .\some-dependency.ps1
* Revisit hash tables...not exactly as I described
* Add try/catch
* Latest version is actually 6.1 (March 2019) and is NOT installed by default on all PCs
